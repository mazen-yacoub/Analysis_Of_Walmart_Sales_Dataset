spending.\n\n  Weekly Sales vs. Unemployment: A negative relationship is observed between unemployment and weekly     sales, as seen in the scatter plot and regression line.\n\n  Weekly Sales vs. CPI: A slight upward trend is noted as CPI increases, indicating that higher           inflation might slightly boost sales.\n\n","metadata":{}}]}
